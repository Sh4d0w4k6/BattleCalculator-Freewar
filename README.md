# BattleCalculator-Freewar
Greasemonkey script for the MMORPG 'http://www.freewar.de/'. It automatically computes if a fight against a NPC on the current field would be winning or loosing for the player. If the outcome is loosing it removes the fast-attack link from the NPC, preventing the player from accidentally dying from the NPC.

The available documentation can be found in [our wiki](https://github.com/ZabuzaW/BattleCalculator-Freewar/wiki).
